## Description
This GitHub repository showcases a group project completed during our Data Analysis course at World Code School. The project was developed by Marion, Joanne, VÃ©ronique, Romain, and me, focusing on creating a platform with an AI-powered chatbot. The platform utilizes a custom-built database, created using information collected from various job offer websites through web scraping and APIs.


## Project Stages
The project involved several key stages:

* **Data Collection**: Identifying job offer sites (APEC, LinkedIn, Welcome to the Jungle, Cadre Emploi, France Travail, Glassdoor) and creating web scraping scripts.
* **Data Cleaning and Storage**: Merging datasets, cleaning the data, and consolidating it into a single database.
* **Application Interface and Chatbot**: Developing a dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) for analysis.
* **Interface**: Developing an application interface and implementing an AI-powered chatbot using machine learning and large language models (LLMs).
